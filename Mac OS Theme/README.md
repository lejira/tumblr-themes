# Mac OS Theme

A theme made to look like an old Mac OS 9 screen. The folders are custom links. You can choose the colors of the fonts and the background of the user description box. Additionally you can choose the background picture and the picture in the small pagination window.

### How to use
Just edit your tumblr theme and replace your code with the one in the html file here. Afterwards you can choose colors and upload background pictures.
